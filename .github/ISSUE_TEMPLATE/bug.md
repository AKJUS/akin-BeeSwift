2. Click on '....'
3. Scroll down to '....'
4. See error]

## Expectata

[A clear/concise description of what you expected to happen]

## Resultata

_Defectus delenda est!_ 

# Nota Nebulosa

[Scratch notes, braindumps, additional context; don't let the above slow you down from reporting something fishy! Report first, ask questions (and fill in repro steps) later!]


# Veni Vidi Vici

["I came, I saw, I conquered", i.e., the report on how it was resolved]
